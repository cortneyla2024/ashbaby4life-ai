## AI Integration

### Learning Plan Generation
The AI generates comprehensive learning plans using prompts like:
```
Create a detailed, step-by-step learning plan for mastering "[SKILL_NAME]". 
Current mastery level: [LEVEL]/100

The plan should include:
1. Foundation concepts to learn
2. Practical exercises and projects
3. Recommended learning resources
4. Milestones and progress indicators
5. Time estimates for each phase
6. Tips for effective learning
```

### Resource Summarization
AI summarizes learning resources with prompts like:
```
Please provide a concise summary of the following learning resource:
Title: [TITLE]
Type: [TYPE]
Content: [CONTENT]

Please create a summary that includes:
1. Key concepts and main points
2. Practical applications or takeaways
3. Difficulty level and prerequisites
4. Estimated time to complete
```
